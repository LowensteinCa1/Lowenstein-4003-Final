## Dashboard Description
This dashboard allows the user to analyze Starbucks' drinks nutritional information. The user can select the drink requirements (drink type, milk type, and size type) in order to get an accurate picture of what the drink's nutritional information looks like.  Then, the user can input another drink's information in order to get a side by side comparision of the drinks' nutrional information.

## Building Process
I began my dashboard building process by deciding what I wanted the layout to look like.  I knew I wanted a graph that updated to different drinks.  To do that, I incorporated a dropdown and two radio buttons to update the graph.  I thought this would created an enjoyable user experience to manipulate the different drinks, sizes, and milk types that would then update the graph.  Then I decided that I wanted it to be a comparison.  So I built another graph.  Because of the UI tools we learned about, I wanted the two graphs positioned next to each other, each taking up 50% of the screen.  I made the graphs a polar bar graph rather than a typical bar graph in order to minimize white space and give better visualization to the user. I also wanted the app to have a coffee shop aesthetic, so I did the graph in a brown gradient, reflecting coffee drink colors.  In addition, I added in the Starbucks logo to reference what this app is all about, as well as changing some of the text color to green. Lastly, I changed the font to bring together the whole coffee shop feel. I integrated CSS code to achieve these stylistic choices.

I worked a lot with chained callbacks in order to get the graph to update based on the three inputs.  I also created a data dictionary for the size options and milk types that assisted in the chained callbacks.  



## Strengths and Learning Experiences
I am very proud of my final result.  Iâ€™m particularly proud of the chained callbacks and how many inputs create a unique output.  The user can change the drink option, the milk type, and the size in order to change the graph and the name of the graph.  I am also proud of the overall aesthetic of the page.  I learned how to incorporate and image and how to place it in a specific location.  In addition, I searched for a font that I thought would bring the whole page together, and I decided on Didot.  I also like how the different shades of brown work with the Starbucks green.  I think my dashboard demonstrates my strong coding knowledge to create a strong user experience, while also exemplifies my integration of UI elements.
